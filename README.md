# Decentralized Social Platform on Lens Protocol.
### Project Summary
Reactos is a decentralized social platform with the sole purpose of rewarding the platform's users with fungible tokens(hopefully Lens or Ethers) through Reactions on contents(full ownership) been posted to the platform. This incentive concept purpose is to create a mass adoption to the Lens ecosystem.

Reactos Lens users will be able to mint their contents to the platform and put it up for sale as NFTs. Other users can either buy the NFT or make reactions to it at a cost, enabling the original creator to be incentivised.

## My Final year project (Under heavy construction)
This project is still and will still be on development since after I went through the Lens API and found out it will solve my ideas much more easily than implementing a social platform from scratch.

# Overview
From the Lens protocol documentation, I used the Lens API to query data while using the deployed contract address from Lens.
A user will need to be authenticated before performing any operation on the platform like making reactions or following up a profile.
I used the Lens API to query Recommended Profiles and Publications. But on the final application, users will have to create Profile which will enable them to make publications, make reactions and much more.

# Plans
As my final year project, I intend on focusing on this project in the coming month and making a product out of it. I will focus on redesigning the UI/UX and implementing more functionalities so as to flood in more users to the Lens ecosystem.
