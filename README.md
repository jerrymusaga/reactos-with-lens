# Decentralized Social Platform on Lens Protocol.
Reactos is a decentralized social platform with the sole purpose of rewarding the platform's users with fungible tokens through Reactions on contents been posted to the platform.

## My Final year project (Under heavy construction)
This project is still and will still be on development since after I went through the Lens API and found out it will solve my ideas much more easily than implementing a social platform from scratch.
